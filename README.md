# Microbiome Predictions Using LLM

- Transfer learning and fine-tuning of a Large Language Model (LLM)
- The model chosen was DNABert, which is a Google BERT model (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) trained for DNA predictions
- Phenotypic was performed using raw FASTQ files, which is the format of next-generation Illumina microbiome sequencing
- More coming soon

#### Project code: Independent AI project with LLM
